Most YouTube to GIF converters slap watermarks on your creations or require signups. YTgify is free, has no watermark, and takes seconds.

## How to Make a GIF from YouTube

1. Install YTgify from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ytgify/okgfnomdcbmlanfmlpljfbmjnlhpgppb)
2. Go to any YouTube video
3. Click the YTgify icon in your toolbar
4. Set start and end times using the timeline controls
5. Click "Create GIF" and download

That's it. Under 30 seconds once you get the hang of it.
