Most YouTube to GIF converters slap watermarks on your creations or require signups. YTgify is free, has no watermark, and takes seconds.

## Two Ways to Make a GIF

### Method 1: Chrome Extension (Fastest)

1. Install YTgify from the Chrome Web Store
2. Go to any YouTube video
3. Click the YTgify icon in your toolbar
4. Set start and end times using the timeline controls
5. Click "Create GIF" and download

That's it. Under 30 seconds once you get the hang of it.

### Method 2: ytgify.com

1. Copy any YouTube URL
2. Paste it at ytgify.com
3. Select your clip with the timeline handles
4. Click "Convert to GIF" and download

Works on any browser, no extension needed.
