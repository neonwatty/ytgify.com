Each platform handles GIFs differently. Use these settings for best results.

## Platform Quick Reference

| Platform | Resolution | FPS | Max Size | Duration |
|----------|------------|-----|----------|----------|
| Twitter/X | 360p | 15 | 15 MB | 6 sec |
| Discord | 360p | 12 | 8 MB* | 10 sec |
| Reddit | 480p | 15 | 20 MB | 15 sec |
| Slack | 240p | 10 | 16 MB | 5 sec |
| Facebook | 480p | 15 | — | 6 sec |

*Discord Nitro: 50 MB

## General Guidelines

<DemoVideo />

**Resolution**: 360p balances quality and file size for most platforms.

**Frame rate**:
- 10 FPS: Small files, slightly choppy
- 15 FPS: Smooth, good file size (recommended)
- 20 FPS: Very smooth, large files

**Duration**: Shorter is better. 2-5 seconds works for most use cases.

## Common Mistakes

- GIF too long (every second adds file size)
- Resolution too high (480p max is enough)
- Poor loop timing (ensure smooth start/end transition)
